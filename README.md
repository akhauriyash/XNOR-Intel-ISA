# XNOR Intel ISA
Attempting to implement XNOR neural network functions (Convolution, GEMM ...) on Intel ISA.
  * The first part of this project aims to create an introductory c file to teach people about OpenMP and parallel programming
  *XNOR functions are yet to be implemented*
##  Prerequisites:
  * Intel® Xeon Phi™ Processor (Any Intel processor should do but code shall attempt to leverage AVX-512 ISA exclusively)
    
##  Note:
  This is a work in progress. There might/should be some mistakes here. 
  Do let me know if you find any logical errors in the code.
  
  
##  TO DO:
  - [ ] Upload codes
  - [ ] Update code gists
  - [ ] Create CLI
  - [ ] Create function timers
  - [ ] Link main function with parser
